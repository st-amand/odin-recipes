      <h2>Steps</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Boil the Noodles: Cook lasagna noodles in a pot of boiling water until
          they become tender. Drain the water and set them aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prepare the Bolognese Sauce: In a large pan, cook ground beef with
          chopped onions and garlic until the meat is browned. Add tomato sauce,
          diced tomatoes, Italian herbs, salt, and pepper. Let it simmer on low
          heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make the Béchamel Sauce: In a separate saucepan, melt butter, then add
          flour and stir until it forms a paste. Slowly pour in milk, whisking
          continuously until the sauce thickens. Season with salt, pepper, and a
          pinch of nutmeg.
        </li>
        <li>
          Layer the Lasagna: In a baking dish, spread a layer of Bolognese sauce
          at the bottom. Place a layer of cooked noodles on top. Then, add a
          layer of béchamel sauce and sprinkle some mozzarella and Parmesan
          cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat the Layers: Continue layering the lasagna with Bolognese sauce,
          noodles, béchamel, and cheese until you run out of ingredients. Ensure
          the top layer is cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake to Perfection: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Cover the
          baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Then, remove
          the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes until the cheese turns
          golden and bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let It Rest: Once baked, let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before
          serving. This helps the flavors to meld together.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve and Enjoy: Cut the lasagna into portions, plate it, and savor
          the delicious layers of flavors in each bite.
