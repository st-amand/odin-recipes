    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Basmati rice</li>
      <li>Chicken</li>
      <li>onion</li>
      <li>yogurt</li>
      <li>garlic paste</li>
      <li>biryani masala</li>
      <li>water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Marinate the Meat/Veggies: In a bowl, mix your choice of meat or
        vegetables with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, biryani masala, and a 
pinch
        of salt. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Soak the Rice: Wash the basmati rice in cold water until the water 
runs
        clear. Then, soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the Rice: In a large pot, bring water or chicken/mutton broth 
to a
        boil. Add the soaked rice and cook it until it's 70-80% cooked. 
Drain
        the water and set the rice aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry the Onions: In a separate pan, heat cooking oil or ghee, and 
fry
        thinly sliced onions until they turn golden brown and crispy. 
Remove
        half of the fried onions and set them aside for garnishing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer the Biryani: In a heavy-bottomed pot, spread a layer of 
marinated
        meat or vegetables at the bottom. Add a layer of partially cooked 
rice
        on top. Sprinkle some saffron strands (or food coloring) and fried
        onions. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used up,
        finishing with a layer of rice on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the Biryani: Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal 
it with
        dough to trap the steam. Cook the biryani on low heat for about 
30-40
        minutes, allowing the flavors to blend together and the rice to 
fully
        cook.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish and Serve: Once the biryani is done, garnish it with fresh
        coriander leaves and the reserved fried onions. Gently mix the 
layers
        before serving to ensure even distribution of flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enjoy Your Biryani: Your delicious biryani is now ready to be 
served!
        Pair it with raita (yogurt-based side dish) or salad for a 
complete
        meal.
      </li>
